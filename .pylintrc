# Pylint configuration file for a QGIS plugin project.
# This file removes outdated options and sets sensible defaults
# for linting QGIS plugin code.

[MAIN]
# A comma-separated list of package or module names from which C extensions may
# be loaded. This helps Pylint understand QGIS/PyQt modules and avoid false
# import errors.
extension-pkg-whitelist=
    PyQt5.QtCore,
    PyQt5.QtGui,
    PyQt5.QtWidgets,
    qgis.core,
    qgis.gui

[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable specific Pylint messages that are often false positives in a QGIS
# plugin context.
#
# C0103 (invalid-name): Often triggered by QGIS conventions like 'iface'.
# E0611 (no-name-in-module), E1101 (no-member): Common with QGIS/PyQt C++ bindings.
# W0611 (unused-import): For resource files that must be imported but appear unused.
# R0903 (too-few-public-methods): Classes can be small and still be useful.
# C0114, C0115, C0116 (missing-docstring): Good to have, but you can enable them later.
